## Possible Improvements For the Demo

1. Optimise per-thread stack size

  - dynamically allocated memory, refactoring, etc
  - use both recommended methods

2. Use inline / static functions vs non-static

3. Timing Optimisation
  - make tighter timings?

4. General Code Cleanliness
  - i think he'll acc look at it this time
  - #define instead of const int for pin defs 

5. Finite Semaphore Ticks
  - copy contents of sysState into local, and only access it then?
    - see how that compares without copying -->
